## GO

Go is a **statically typed**, **compiled** high-level programming language 

### Duck typing 

is an application of the duck testâ€”"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck"
With duck typing, an object is of a given type if it has all methods and properties required by that type. Duck typing may be viewed as a usage-based structural equivalence between a given object and the requirements of a type.

Go uses structural typing on methods to determine compatibility of a type with an interface.
